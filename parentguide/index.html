				<h2>Can I let them play?</h2>
				
					<p>What you should know about gaming...Videogames are ubiquitous. They are an inevitable part of your child's life in some form or another. As parent's we worry 
					about the latest studies that warn of harming the brain devolopment of our babies, to the constant warnings of violence in videogames grooming our little ones for a life
					of crime. I humbly assert that if we as parent's use a bit of common sense regarding the exposure and content of the video games we allow our children to play, we can 
					feel confident that they will grow up to be contributing members of society. If we choose to allow a handheld game, such as Angry Bird's to babysit for 15 minutes while 
					unloading the groceries or while sitting in the doctor's office vs. allowing a child to sit indoors playing 2 hours of same game instead of riding his bike, using common sense,
					we can be certain that in small doses, no harm will come to the child.  Most parents can see the difference and most parents will try to be informed when making these decisions. This site
					will try to fill in the gaps between complete fear mongering and sound parenting decisions.
					</p>
					
					<p>How are games rated?  The US government has made it unlawful to sell videogames without a rating printed on the outside cover of the game package.  This is a great reference to
					alert you to games that are inappropriate for your child.  Common sense will prevail if one adheres to the ESRB ratings.  The game will have a small image of the rating for a quick reference to
					what the game contains regarding language, explicit content, and mature themes. For more detailed information about the ratings, one can click the link to the ratings page of this site!</p>
					
					<p>What is multiplayer and how do I protect my teen...One must have a clear understanding of what multiplayer entails.  Multiplayer simply means more than one player can play the game, however, it 
					does get more complicated than that.  Today, multiplayer involves playing online with other players with no distinction of age or identity of other players online.  XBOX live and the Playstation network are two common online gaming
					services that make a videogame a "multiplayer" game. The player signs in with a gamertag and is connected to a lobby of other gamers where they can talk and play with each other. This is a great way to play 
					videogames by the way, but the common sense approach to being a parent should send up a red flag.  As parents, we need to monitor our children in this circumstance and both of these services provide parents with 
					ways to limit who has access to your child. I strongly recommend that parents take the time to research how to set up their platforms or devices to control this feature. It is easy
					and reliable and will give you peace of mind.
					</p>
					
					<p>Common Sense Parenting...I can not emphasize enough the impact of responsible parenting and a common sense approach to online and videogame monitoring for the overall health of your child.
					Limit the amount of time a child plays, balance physical activity to screen time, know who your children are playing with online and please stay involved in the process, society will thank you!</p>
