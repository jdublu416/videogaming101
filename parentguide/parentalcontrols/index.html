					<h2>How do I protect my kids?</h2>
				
						<p>According to the ESRB ratings site, "Parental controls allow parents to limit their children's video game use.
						It is available for all current consoles, handhelds and computers, 
						they can be activated to block games by ESRB rating category, 
						regulate the amount of time your child can play, and restrict access to the Internet."</p>
						
						
						<p>All major gaming consoles are equipped with parental controls to allow parents
						to restrict access to content and also restrict who they can connect with socially on the internet. 
						The controls can be very specific by limiting online play to friends
						only and it can also not allow conversations with other gamers who are not on the childs "friend list". 
						Whichever console you own, the first step is setting up a gaming account that will be the "master account". This will give you the ability to use the
						parent or family settings.  For example PlayStation4 will have the master account and then subaccounts for your children whereas XBox1 labels it 
						the family profile.</p>

						<p>Parents also need to be aware that each console has their own gaming community where you purchase a membership to access games online. The cost for this service is roughly $60/year
						and the paid memberships, while not required, offer many discounts and perks as well as online multiplayer.  If you choose to purchase the membership, you may 
						have to set more parental controls to limit the online "party"/gamechat access. Do not think that because you didn't purchase it with your credit card that your child 
						does not have access.  Some games will enclose a free trial for a limited time and your child can get online by merely entering a code. I encourage all parents to 
						be thorough from the get go thus avoiding future surprises.</p>
						
						
						<p>The number one way to know what your kids are watching or playing is to stay involved and stay connected.  
						Perhaps you can pick up a controller if if you haven't already!</p>
