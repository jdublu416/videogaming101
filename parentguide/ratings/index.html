					<h2>A first line of defense:</h2>
				
						<p>The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) assigns age and content ratings for video games
						and mobile apps that enforces guidelines for the industry. Video game companies are required by law to list
						the rating along with specificities regarding the content.  Similar to how movies are rated, parents can use this 
						rating system to understand how explicit the content their children are being exposed to before purchasing a game.
