					<h2>What? No Joystick?</h2>
						
						<p>  If you haven't heard of an arcade, picked up a controller, or if you've been living under
						a rock for the last 40 years, you may be unfamiliar with terms like "gamer", "first person shooter" 
						or "RPG".  Video games have been part of our culture for a while and everyone living 
						today, young or old, has heard of video games but the days of putting a quarter in a machine and moving a joystick around are
						long gone.  The gaming industry has grown into a multi-million dollar industry and as technology has grown so has the 
						complexity of games available to the consumer.</p>
						
						
						<p>One can choose zombie apocolypse games or war themed games, and fantasy games or sports games.  Arcade style games are no 
						longer enough for the average consumer.  Video games today pull the player into alternate worlds where they can leave their
						real life struggles behind and save the world or play in the superbowl.  The graphics are realistic enough to play like a blockbuster
						movie and the storylines are as complex as any novel on the New York Times bestseller list. Today's consumer expects their $60 purchase
						to be top of the line and if the video game company delivers, it's the golden egg for everyone involved.</p>
						
						
						<p>This site is here to educate you and help you learn the ropes to become a gamer!  So pick your platform and get ready to lose
						yourself in an alternate reality!</p>
