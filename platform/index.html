					<h2>There are three main platforms to play your favorite videogames:</h2>
						
						<ul>

							<li><strong>Console</strong> games for dedicated machines like the PlayStation, Xbox and Wii (as well as handheld devices like the PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS)</li>
								
							<li><strong>Computer</strong> games for the PC and Mac</li>
								
							<li>Mobile games for <strong>smartphones and tablets</strong></li>
							
						</ul>
					
							<p>Video gaming globally has become a $66 billion dollar industry according to DFC Intelligience, a research company, and it is expected to grow to $79 billion. Consumers can choose 
							between playing on their phone or computer, or a specialized machine like XBox or Playstation. It is not uncommon for kids under age 12 to carry a handheld gaming device,
							a NintendoDS or a PlayStation Vita, where they can then graduate to playing games on their smartphone if their parents splurge for it. Console games usually connect to the
							internet to further enhance the social aspect of gaming. This allows connecting to other players across the globe! Even the handheld games can boast multiplayer online capabilities.
							Each platform has its own set of pros and cons, however, ultimately the consumer has the final say.</p>
							
							
							<p>Originally, video games were primarily sold on discs (or back in the day, cartridges) and one had to go to a electronics store to purchase them. 
							Now with increasingly available internet, many games are downloaded straight to the chosen platform.
							Some are available for free download but do not be fooled, players may be asked to pay for extra content within a game
							to help them enhance their gameplay. These are called micro-transactions and are very common on smartphone/tablet games, thus adding to the revenue. Take note parents, this
							can be an additional headache if your child has access to purchase online content on their phones or consoles.</p>
							
							<p>Gaming in the home environment is a huge part of the gaming industry and now there are more options to acheive this than ever.  The main consoles are the XBox,
							PlayStation and the Wii, with each offering a similar list of gaming titles available, however, each console has game franchises that are only available on the one console. For example, PlayStation offers games like 
							<em>The Last of Us</em> and <em>Drake's Fortune</em> that are exclusive to their console. The Wii competes in the market by offering a different style of gameplay where the player uses his body
							to control the gameplay. One can also build a more powerful home computer with a graphics card that supports massively multiplayer games like <em>World of Warcraft</em> that continue 
							to be popular among gaming enthusiasts. Whatever your preference, there is a perfect fit out there for you to enjoy gaming to the fullest!</p>
