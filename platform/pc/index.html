				<h2>Playing games on your home computer...
				</h2>
				
				<p>Early gaming on computers was restricted to mostly hobbyists and frankly, games that were available were limited to text games where game code
				was typed into the computer, making it too difficult for the average person.  Computer gaming at the time was limited by its lack of graphics and the console gaming industry was booming. It became less popular but did not 
				die altogether and by 1989 Computer Gaming World reported that "the industry is moving toward heavy use of VGA graphics", a display hardware that increased screen resolution.
				</p>
			
				
				<p>By the 1990's, the computer companies were struggling to keep their customers from associating their products with game machines. Despite their efforts, computer games
				continued to rise in popularity.  It became known that the speed of the processor on the PC allowed for more realistic games and the CD/ROM came into play, allowing for a larger storage
				capacity.  This was a shift for the gaming developers who then began to focus on digital aspects such as art and music at the expense of actual gameplay.  The problems that 
				plagued the PC gaming community rested in the consumption of memory, requiring users to make complicated adjustments to their computer settings.  Microsoft was able to simplify
				driver and memory management along with more interest in hardware accelerated 3D graphics on PCs, which opened the door for more mind blowing gaming experiences.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Present day PC gaming boasts far more processing power than other gaming systems.  Games running on PCs have better screen resolution, higher framerate, and anti-aliasing.
				PC games often support more players than other platforms and also supports greater input fidelity. For instance, the mouse increases speed and accuracy for first person
				shooter games and real-time strategy games. 
				</p>
				
				<p>Another advantage to PC gaming is the lack of centralized control as with all other gaming platforms which are owned by a single group.  This "openness" as it's
				called keeps software costs down, increases flexibility with old games being played on more modern systems, increased innovation through updating or modifying an
				existing game which in turn pushes the evolution of this platform's hardware and software.</p>
				
				<p>The disadvantages lie in the cost of the hardware and the complexity of its inner workings. There is more software piracy and cheating than closed platforms. The 
				openness allows players to edit their games and then distribute the results over the internet as mods thus cutting into profits and work against developer's plans for regular
				sequels.</p>
				
				<p>There are two dominant software forces, Microsoft Windows and Steam distribution service which enables PC games to be predominantly sold over the internet.  The buyers
				download their purchases directly to their computers which avoids the speed and capacity limits of the optical disks used predominantly in console gaming however, console
				gaming companies are now offering digital downloads as well.</p>
				
				
				<p>Buying a powerful PC pre-built for gaming can cost twice as much as a console but you can use your PC for other activities especially if you were going to buy a new
				computer anyway. To get an even better deal, you can build your own machine at a fraction of the cost!  You can also tell yourself that the computer will eventually
				pay for itself with the money you save on the game prices.</p>
