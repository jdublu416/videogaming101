				<h2>Examples of actual gameplay on a popular console:</h2>
				
					<p class= "adjpar">This video is from the Dead Rising franchise. It is rated M and is in the horror genre. This clip shows the main character riding a
					motorcycle and using it as a weapon.</p>

					<p class= "adjpar">This video is from the sports genre that has an E for everyone rating and simulates an NBA basketball season. Players can have a mock draft and 
					simulate a faux season using actual NBA players.</p>

					<p class= "adjpar">Sometimes video games have unusual groundbreaking aspects that excite fans and attract more players.
					This clip shows swimming underwater with full combat capabilities.</p>

					<p class= "adjpar">Gaming graphics have vastly improved as technology has improved. 
					The graphics are so clear, one can shoot across the map and make a great long shot.</p>

					<p class= "adjpar">Multiplayer games are an attraction because every game plays differently since players are matched with typically 11 other gamers in
					their gaming lobby.  Video games offer a variety of objective games similar to the video clip. This game is a variation of 6v6 team play where the objective is 
					to collect a set number of dogtags (that drop when a player is killed). The team that reaches a total of 100 dogtags or collects the most tags in 10 minutes, whichever
					comes first, decides who wins.</p>

					<p class= "adjpar">Basketball games are not the only popular sportsgames to buy.  FIFA is another video game that simulates the soccer season.  Like NBA2K17, FIFA allows 
					players to play competitively online or play offline against the computer.  Every four years, this video game franchise allows World Cup competitions! 
					It generally is highly rated due to its realism and ability to give players a taste of the professional soccer experience.</p>
					
						<iframe width="600" height="337" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ADGX0wD5Vn0"></iframe>
						
					<p class= "adjpar">Games have become more graphic where blood and gore are accompanied by movie-like soundtracks, simulating mutilation. This video clip is from Dying Light,
					a popular horror genre, that shows the protagonist using a melee weapon to kill hordes of zombies.  The blood spray and sound effects add to the allure of killing the
					undead.  The player will get startled and outright frightened by the gameplay, adding to the excitement of the experience.  This genre has grown in popularity despite
					its grotesque content.</p>
