					<h2>When was the first video game?</h2>
				
					<p>It's hard to believe that the first introduction to video gaming for the public was in 1940. During the 1940 World's Fair, Westinghouse had a game called NIM on
					display that allowed players to battle the computer in their attempt to avoid picking up the last matchstick.  Although 90% of the games played resulted
					in the user losing to the computer, it sparked the imagination of the crowds.  It took nearly three decades for video games to advance to something similar to 
					today's consoles, but in 1966, Ralph Baer invents the "brown box" which is the proto-type for future gaming as we know it. Over the next several decades, the war for 
					dominance in the global market allows for advances in gaming that wins over the public; Today we see 4 out of 5 households owning at least one video game console,
					something that no one ever thought possible in 1977;  Magnavox releases the <em>Odyssey</em> (the first by a few months) and Atari releases the <em>Atari 2600</em>, thus giving birth to 
					the home video computer console.</p>
					
					<p>The late 1970's gave rise to 15 new companies that over saturate the video gaming market.  This caused the video game crash in 1983. It was
					make or break for the industry, those that survived were able to forge ahead capitalizing on all of the advances that this "war" created.  Companies that are well known today, Nintendo, Mattel, Sony,
					and Namco, dominated the 80's with groundbreaking games like <i>Pacman, Donkey Kong, Legend of Zelda and John Madden Football</i>. By 1989, Nintendo popularizes handheld gaming with the release of
					the <em>GameBoy</em>. Each year that passes, video gaming is gaining more footing with people that would never have tried video games; In 1990, MicroSoft bundles Solitaire with it's <em>Windows 3.0</em>, giving
					access to video games to every owner of their computer.</p>
					
					<p>By the early 1990's, big hitter's like Sega are winning the "war" with game mascots like Sonic the Hedgehog.  At the same time, <i>Dune II</i> is released which intrduces us to
					real-time strategy games.  Other games like <i>Mortal Kombat</i> and <i>Doom</i>, which showcase bloodshed, are shining a light on the video game violence controversy. The American Congress
					establishes a video game rating system that is similar to the rating system for movies. By 1995, the release of the <em>Playstation</em> by Sony weakens Sega's hold on the console market and by 2000, 
					the release of the <em>PlayStation 2</em> kills Sega's home console.  This makes room for Microsoft's <em>XBOX</em> in 2001 winning their market share with games like <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i>. Just 4 years later, <em>XBOX 360</em>
					is released and gains more users with their advanced graphics and seamless online play.</p>
					
					<p>The first decade of the new millenium sees new technology combined with the expanding video game market.  Nintendo releases its <em>Wii</em> revolutionizing video games with motion sensitive
					remotes making video gaming an activity.  Nintendo also releases the groundbreaking <em>Nintendo DS</em> which is equipped with two processors, 2 screens, capable of multiplayer, and a stylus for 
					the touchscreen. PC gaming also sees an increase in support with the advent of the digital distribution platform, <em>Steam</em>.  In 2007, <i>Rockband</i> is released and is extremely popular enabling a
					way for people to become more social and interact with video games in a new way. By now, gaming is a worldwide phenomenon and in 2008, World of Warcraft gains 10 million subscribers giving entire virtual universes
					for players to enjoy while playing with complete strangers accross the globe.</p>
					
					<p>By 2009, with the release of <i>Farmville</i> and <i>Angry Birds</i>, people are now playing video games on <em>Facebook</em> and their phones. It is no surprise that 42% of Americans are gamers, even Grandmas
					are playing Angry Birds. Video games are here to stay.  If you are on the computer, you have access and access allows people to try something new, oftentimes filling their freetime with addictive fun games. The war continues and for now it looks like
					we the people are the winners!</p>
